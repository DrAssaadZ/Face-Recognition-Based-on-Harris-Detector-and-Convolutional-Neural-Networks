The project Structure : 
the project contains 4 folders : 
	----Classifical methods : which contain the codes for classicals methods : LBP, EigenFaces, FisherFaces
	----CNN : which contains the code for CNN model on 3 datasets avaible in two versions : 
			---> Jupyter Files :  the CNN model is available as a jupyter notebook
			---> Python Files :	the CNN model is available as normal python files
	----original datasets: containing the original three datasets (before applying the split into test and train) 
	----datasets : this folder will be created when running the main python file, which contains all the 
					3 splitted (train and test) datasets along with their corresponding Region of interest images
					each dataset folder contains the following : 
					--->orig_images: contains the splitted dataset (into train and test)
					--->ROI images : images used for our method, which contain two more folders:	
						-ROI dataset: used by our method by the CNN module 
						-KNN dataset: ised by our method by the decision module


					and the datasets needed for the decision module of our method (noted as KNN dataset)
	----Our proposed method : which contains two modules (CNN and decision modules) of our proposed method, while the third 						module is localed in this same project (named preprocessing)

the project contains the following python files:
	----cornerDetectors.py : which contains the the corner detection algorithms, this file is called in the preprocessing 
							python file
	----preprocessing.py : which contains the datasets preprocessing (splitting) methods, the code which creates the region of interest image datasets (our first module) is included in the file 
	----Main.py : which is the main file of our propsed method, it calls all the other modules (preprocessing, CNN, and decision module)					 

----------------
To execute the code of our method : run the main.py file with all modules on the specified dataset
to execute the codes for CNN and the classifical methods : run the file inside the folder; these methodes require the "datasets folder " which is created by running the first module of the main.py file.
